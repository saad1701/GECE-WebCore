How to run locally

Unzip frontend.zip
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

Visit the URL shown (Vite dev server), click “Login (Mock)”, and navigate the left nav tabs
The Header page demonstrates creating/listing projects via MSW-mocked API
What’s included

Routing and protected routes with a mock login (replace with real OIDC later)
API client with bearer injection
React Query provider and example query/mutation
MSW mocks for:
GET /api/v1/auth/me
GET/POST /api/v1/projects
POST uploads/calculate/exports endpoints
POST /api/v1/ai/explain
Tab routes matching your PyQt screens:
Header, Best Practices, Controls, Device Integration, ESD, TMC, Testing, Documentation, Meetings, Report, Free Format, Custom Training, Site Services, Travel & Living, System, Summary, Metrics, About
Next steps I can do on your go

Wire actual field forms for each tab based on your JSON files and screenshots
Generate a typed API client from openapi-v1.yaml
Add role/tenant guards and error/latency mock scenarios
Prepare env-based baseURL and OIDC configuration for seamless backend swap
You’re all set to iterate UI quickly while the backend is built to the same OpenAPI contract.
________________________
Notes:

You have a valid Vite+React+TS layout: index.html, src/ (App.tsx, main.tsx, pages/ components/), vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, package.json.

API mocks present: mocks/browser.ts, mocks/handlers.ts (Windows mislabels .ts as video — harmless).

public/ can be empty — fine.

What this gives you:

UI runs fully with MSW mocks (fake login, fake endpoints).

No real backend/auth yet despite openapi-v1.yaml.

What you’d still need only for real backend:

.env with VITE_API_BASE_URL (and OIDC vars if used).

Replace mock auth/provider and handlers with real API client.

If package.json has a dev script (expected with Vite), you’re good to go.
